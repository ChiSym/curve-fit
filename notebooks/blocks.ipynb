    "# DSL for curve fit inference\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the `genjax.interpreted` performance investigation, I wanted to investigate a DSL for the curve-fitting task which could achieve JAX-accelerated performance without introducing JAX concepts such as the Switch and Map combinators, `in_axes`, and other things that might complicate the exposition of inference for the newcomer. While doing so, I also studied ways to \"automatically\" thread randomness through the computation without having to discuss the careful use of `jax.random.split` which we recommend to GenJAX users. Having done the experiment, I have mixed feelings about the results: on the one hand, it is possible to get JAX-level performance with curve-building combinators, but the price of so doing is that the GFI is hidden from view as well, and that may be too far a step. Nonetheless, if you're still interested in what can be achieved in this framework, read on!"

The experience of doing this helped me to understand JAX better. In particular, the idea of creating a custom `Pytree` object seemed exotic to me before I started this, but: if you want to have a Generative Function that produces something other than an array, while retaining full JAX-compatibility, it's exactly what you should do. In this case, the DSL allows the construction and composition of Generative Functions that sample from distributions of real-valued functions on the real line, and that's what curve fitting is about.\n",
